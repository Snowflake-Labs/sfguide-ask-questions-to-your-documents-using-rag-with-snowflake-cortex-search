# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM assistant using Streamlit and Snowflake Cortex Search

## Overview

In this quickstart we will show you how to quickly and securely build a full-stack RAG application in Snowflake without having to build integrations, manage any infrastructure or deal with security concerns with data moving outside of the Snowflake governance framework.

This guide will leverage Cortex Search, a fully managed service that automatically creates embeddings for your data and perform retrievals using a hybrid search engine, using embeddings for semantic similarity plus keyword search for lexical similarity, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval quality.
